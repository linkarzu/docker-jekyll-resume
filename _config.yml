about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I like to learn about new stuff related to technology, not specific to a particular field. 
  Whether it's Linux, networking, virtualization, containerization, cloud services, web design, programming - you name it; 
  if it's something I can use in real life, I'm down for learning and applying it. 

# Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.

# You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
#   - Lists
#   - Tables
#   - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
#   - Images ![alt text](/images/landscape-trees.jpg "Trees")

# To reduce space between elements I modified _sass/modern-resume-theme.scss

      - I can adapt quickly and connect the dots to understand how things work. If I don't know an answer, I'm not going to 
        pretend I know and give you false information, I'll tell you to give me some time and come back with something useful.
      - My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my CCNA 
        back in 2018, but then I relized that networking is just a small part of the landscape, so I'be been trying to catch
        up to new technologies ever since.
      - I love taking notes, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy wordpress on a docker container in a GCP VM,
        I'll document the whole process in case I need to re-do it. I used to manage my notes in Google Docs
        But they're too slow to load, so migrated all my notes to Obsidian, so now everything is handled as
        mardown files and automatically uploaded to my github account.
