  ## Skills and interests:
    - I'm highly skilled and experienced in managing and deploying enterprise monitoring solutions, including the setup of integrations between monitoring tools for alerting and paging via PagerDuty or other paging tool
    - I'm familiar with the DevOps model, taking an application from code to a container registry, then to a Helm chart, and finally deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster. Everything managed through CI/CD pipelines, with ArgoCD handling deployments.
    - I have experience with the incident management process, worked as an SRE for LogMeIn for a few years.
    - I have several professional level certifications, including `CKA: Certified Kubernetes Administrator` and `CCNP` by Cisco
    - I'm a huge Neovim fan, macOS is my daily driver, and Debian is my Linux distro of choice for servers.

  ## A bit more about me:
    - I enjoy spending time in my homelab, I have a 3 node XCP-NG cluster in which I run several VMs, including 3 DNS servers using bind9, a 3 control plane and 3 worker node HA kubernetes cluster, 3 node docker swarm cluster, 3 node glusterfs storage cluster. I run several containers, for example: Traefik as an ingress and for SSL certs, samba server, zabbix server, a registry, databases, apt-cacher-ng and more.
    - I have a Mikrotik router with a dual ISP connection and configured scripts to failover to the backup ISP when the main ISP goes down. Also have a small managed switch in which I configured VLANs, and also have a dedicated separate network for Wi-Fi guests.
    - My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my Cisco CCNA certification, but I then soon realized that networking is just a small part of the landscape.
    - I love documenting my work, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy a 3 control plane HA kubernetes cluster, I'll document the whole process in case I need to re-do it.
